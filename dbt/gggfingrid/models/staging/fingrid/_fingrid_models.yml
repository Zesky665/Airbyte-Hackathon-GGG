    description: >
      The source data from the FinGrid, is a staging model that drops the startTIme field as it is identical to the endTime field, and adds a source identifier column.
      The source data is Deduplicated and all columns are filtered with Not Null checks. This is for the Hydroelectric Electricy Production Data.
